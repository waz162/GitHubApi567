# GitHubApi567

2. Write a description of what you thought about when you were designing the code.  
What did *you* think was important to do to make it easy to test the program.  
What are some of the challenges that you faced when testing this assignment.

When I was designing the code I found it a little difficult to get the ball rolling because
I had to figure out how to use Json and the github api. To make it easy to test I had To
quantify failure and success. To do this I said that if the function was successfuly ran and
returned what it needed to it was successful. If not it would be a failure. The challenges
were first setting up the code to even work, learning API's was interesting but a little complicated.
Then figuring out how to set up a test case was a little bit of a struggle. The most difficuult
part of the assignment was trying to work around the github api limit. This stopped a lot of the work flow
